Articles in our database (n=97,945) were classified into one of 50 concepts using a continuous time dynamic topic model (LDA-cDTM), a Bayesian hierarchical model that uses Brownian motion to model 'concepts' over time for the entire database. All analyses in this repository make use of the model's results; for further details about the LDA-cDTM, please contact [Dylan Craven](mailto:dylan.craven@aya.yale.edu).
