## Description  

This repository contains data and code used to assess concept diversity and interdisciplinarity in biodiversity science from 1990 - 2012. Articles in our database (n=97,945) were classified into one of 50 concepts using a continuous time dynamic topic model (LDA-cDTM), a hierarchical Bayesian model that uses Brownian motion to model concepts over time. All analyses in this repository make use of the model's results; for further details about the LDA-cDTM, please contact [Dylan Craven](mailto:dylan.craven@aya.yale.edu).
